# SAM3A, SAM3N, SAM3S, SAM3U, and SAM3X support for Rust

This repo has various crates that support/enable working with Atmel `sam3a`, `sam3n`, `sam3s`,
`sam3u`, and `sam3x` devices using Rust.

This project is currently in _very_ early stages of development, and so is effectively unuseable. It
will be worked on by me as my motivation sees fit, though outside contributions are more than
welcome.
